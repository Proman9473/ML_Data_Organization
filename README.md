## merger.py
This script seems to be used for organizing image and XML files in a certain directory structure. It goes through a specified input directory (`data_dir`), looks for `.jpg` and `.xml` files, and copies these files to a new output directory (`output_dir`). It creates a mapping between the original file name and the new file name, and this mapping is saved in a text file (`mapping.txt`). This could be useful in a machine learning project where you have a dataset of images and corresponding XML files (which might contain annotations or metadata for the images), and you want to reorganize the dataset and keep track of how files were renamed.

## shuf_rollback.py
This script appears to reverse a shuffling operation on a dataset split into 'train', 'test', and 'val' (validation) subdirectories. For each subdirectory, it moves the `.jpg` and corresponding `.xml` files from the specified input directory (`input_dir`) to an output directory (`output_dir`). This might be used to rollback a previous operation that shuffled and split a dataset for machine learning, returning the files to their original location.

## shuffle_data.py
This script is used to shuffle a dataset and split it into 'train', 'test', and 'validation' subsets. It reads image files from an input directory (`input_image_dir`), shuffles them, and then divides them into subsets based on the specified split percentages (`train_percent`, `test_percent`, `val_percent`). It also moves corresponding label files and XML files to the same subsets. This would be useful for preparing a machine learning dataset, where typically the dataset is randomly split into a training set used to train the model, a validation set used to tune hyperparameters, and a test set used to evaluate the final model.
